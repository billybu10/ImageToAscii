# ImageToASCII
As the name suggests, this program converts image to ascii art. Uses [PIL](https://python-pillow.org/).

It has two versions:
* ITA_woarg.py (short for ImageToASCII without arguments) is simpler version, that asks for input.
* ITA.py uses command line arguments.

This repo is mostly me trying to follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_raWlX7tZY) and [this site](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html). I'm not really good at python and there are other projects, which probably suit your needs better and are written by more experienced python devs.
