# ImageToASCII
As the name suggests, this program converts image to ascii art.
(perfect if you want to turn your teacher into ascii art *winky face*)

It has two versions:
* ITA_woarg.py (short for ImageToASCII without arguments) is simpler version, that asks for input.
* ITA.py uses command line arguments.

That's my first project using git. It's sh*tty and there are others, that do this job way better. Made with help of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_raWlX7tZY) and [this site](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html).
